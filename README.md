# wav-processing

The aim of this project is to play around with some sample audio files and deals with three main things:
1) Audio formats and interconvertability
2) Processing audio files to make them suitable for input to a neural network
3) Visualizing what happens to an audio file at different stages of processing

THe future aim of this project is to find a less lossy compression format for audio files than mp3
